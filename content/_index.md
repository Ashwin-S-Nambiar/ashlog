Welcome!
```

AshLog is my **personal knowledge vault**, a place where I collect notes, ideas, and learnings as I grow as a developer.

Unlike polished blog posts, the notes here are often raw, evolving, and interconnected more like a **digital garden** than a traditional blog.

## What you’ll find here
- Notes on technologies I’m learning ([[Web Development]], [[Next.js]], [[React]], Azure, etc.)
- Debugging tips and tricky problems I’ve solved
- [[Projects]], Code snippets, patterns, and reusable references
- Reflections on my projects and experiments

HTML (**HyperText Markup Language**) is the **standard markup language** used to structure content on the web. Along with [[CSS]] and [[JavaScript]], it forms the foundation of modern web development.

## Key Features

### Document Structure
HTML defines the structure of a web page using **elements** such as `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.  
- `<head>` includes metadata, links to stylesheets, and scripts.  
- `<body>` contains the visible page content.  

### Semantic Elements
Modern HTML emphasizes semantic tags like `<header>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>` that describe the meaning of content. This improves accessibility, SEO, and code readability.

### Multimedia Support
Provides elements like `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>` for embedding media directly into web pages.

### Forms and Input
HTML includes a variety of form controls (`<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<button>`) for collecting user input. Forms are often paired with [[JavaScript]] for validation and dynamic behavior.

### Hyperlinks and Navigation
The `<a>` element enables linking between pages, forming the core of the **web’s hypertext system**.

### Integration with [[CSS]] and [[JavaScript]]
- [[CSS]] is used to style and visually format the elements defined in HTML.  
- [[JavaScript]] manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) created by HTML, enabling interactivity.

## Advantages
- Provides a universal, standardized way of structuring documents on the web  
- Semantic elements improve accessibility and SEO  
- Simple syntax makes it easy to learn and widely adopted

## Purpose
HTML’s primary role is to define **content and structure**. Combined with [[CSS]] for presentation and [[JavaScript]] for behavior, it enables the creation of **dynamic, responsive, and interactive** web applications, including [[Single Page Applications]] built with frameworks like [[React]] and powered by build tools such as [[Vite]].

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on stateless, client-server communication over HTTP, where resources are represented using standard formats like JSON or XML.  

REST is widely used in [[notes/API]] development, powering much of modern [[notes/Web Development]] through predictable endpoints and standardized methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  

## Purpose
REST simplifies integration between systems, making APIs more scalable, flexible, and easy to consume.

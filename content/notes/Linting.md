**Linting** is the process of analyzing source code to detect errors, stylistic issues, and potential bugs before execution. It helps enforce coding standards and maintain consistency across projects.  

Tools like ESLint (for [[notes/JavaScript]]) and Pylint (for Python) are commonly used in modern [[notes/Web Development]] workflows. Linting often integrates with CI/CD pipelines, IDEs, and version control systems to automate quality checks.  

## Purpose
Linting improves code readability, reduces runtime errors, and enforces best practices across development teams.

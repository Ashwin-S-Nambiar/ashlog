**Motion (previously as Framer Motion)** is a production ready animation and gesture library for [[notes/React]]. It provides a declarative API for creating smooth, complex animations with minimal code.

## Key Features
### Declarative Animations
- Define animations using simple props like `animate`, `initial`, and `exit`  
- Enables smooth entrance/exit animations for components  
### Gestures
- Built-in support for drag, hover, tap, and scroll interactions  
- Enhances user experience with interactive elements  
### Variants
- Define reusable animation states for multiple components  
- Simplifies complex motion patterns with shared states  
### Layout Animations
- Animate layout changes automatically using `layout` prop  
- Useful for dynamic interfaces such as lists, grids, or watchlists  
### Integration
- Works seamlessly with [[notes/React]] and styling systems like [[notes/CSS]] or [[notes/TailwindCSS]]  
- Often used in projects built with [[notes/Vite]] or [[notes/Next.js]]  

## Advantages
- High-performance animations without requiring deep CSS or SVG knowledge  
- Intuitive API designed for developers already familiar with [[notes/React]]  
- Declarative and composable motion patterns  

## Purpose
Motion enables developers to create **modern, interactive, and fluid user interfaces** in [[notes/Web Development]] projects, enhancing engagement without sacrificing maintainability.

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** defines a set of rules and protocols that allow different software systems to communicate with each other. In web development, APIs often expose data or services over the internet, enabling integration between frontend and backend systems.  

APIs can follow patterns like [[notes/REST]] or GraphQL, and are essential in connecting client applications (e.g., [[notes/React]], [[notes/Svelte]]) with server-side logic. They are also widely used for third-party services such as [[notes/Open Trivia DB]].  

## Purpose
APIs act as bridges, ensuring modular, reusable, and scalable interactions between different parts of an application or across platforms.

## Overview
**Public APIs** are publicly available [[notes/API]]s that allow developers to access, integrate, and use data or services, often for free, without needing to host the backend or manage large datasets.  

Public APIs are particularly useful in projects where developers want quick access to structured data or services without building them from scratch.

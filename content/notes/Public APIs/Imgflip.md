## Overview
The **Imgflip API** is a [[notes/REST]]ful [[notes/Public APIs|public]] JSON API that enables developers to integrate meme generation and template retrieval directly into applications. It provides endpoints to fetch popular meme templates, caption images or GIFs, and even generate AI-based memes. This makes it ideal for apps or projects centered around humor, memes, or user-generated content.

**Open Trivia Database (OpenTDB)** is a free-to-use, community-driven API that provides a wide collection of trivia questions across multiple categories and difficulty levels. It is often used to build quiz or trivia-based applications, making it a valuable resource for projects involving [[notes/Web Development]], [[notes/JavaScript]], or [[notes/React]].  

Developers can fetch random or filtered trivia questions via its [[REST]] API endpoints, allowing dynamic integration into apps, games, and learning platforms.

## Purpose
OpenTDB simplifies the process of sourcing quiz content, so developers can focus on building interactive experiences rather than curating large datasets.

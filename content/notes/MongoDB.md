**MongoDB** is a popular **[[notes/NoSQL]] database** that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is widely used in [[notes/Web Development]] projects that require scalability, high availability, and quick iteration cycles.  

Website: [https://www.mongodb.com/](https://www.mongodb.com/)  

Unlike relational databases that use tables and rows, MongoDB uses **collections and documents**. Each document is a flexible schema object expressed in BSON (Binary JSON), making it highly adaptable for projects built with [[notes/JavaScript]] frameworks like [[notes/Next.js]] and [[notes/React]].  

## Features
- **Schema Flexibility**: No enforced schema allows rapid development and changes.  
- **Scalability**: Built-in support for horizontal scaling (sharding).  
- **Indexing**: Secondary indexes to optimize queries.  
- **Aggregation Framework**: Powerful tools for data transformation and analytics.  
- **Replication**: High availability via replica sets.  
- **Integration**: Works well with Node.js ecosystems through libraries like `mongoose` or the official MongoDB driver.  

## Usage Example
### Basic Document
```json
{
  "title": "First Blog Post",
  "author": "Ashwin",
  "tags": ["nextjs", "mongodb", "webdev"],
  "published": true,
  "createdAt": "2024-10-05T10:00:00Z"
}
```
### Connecting with Node.js
```javascript
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
await client.connect();

const db = client.db("quillify");
const posts = db.collection("posts");

const result = await posts.insertOne({
  title: "My First Post",
  author: "Ashwin",
});
```

## Advantages
* Fast iteration due to schema flexibility
* Scales easily with sharding and clustering
* Works seamlessly with \[\[notes/JavaScript]] applications
* JSON/BSON structure maps directly to application objects

## Limitations
* Less suited for applications requiring strict schema and transactions
* Querying can become complex without proper indexing
* Schema flexibility can lead to inconsistent data if not managed carefully

## Purpose
MongoDB is ideal for **modern, agile application development** where requirements evolve quickly. In projects like *Quillify*, it provides flexible storage for user accounts, blog posts, and subscriptions while integrating smoothly with \[\[notes/Next.js]] APIs and authentication workflows.

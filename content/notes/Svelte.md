**Svelte** is a modern frontend framework for building highly efficient and reactive web applications. Unlike frameworks such as [[notes/React]], Svelte shifts work from the browser to the build step, compiling components into optimized vanilla [[notes/JavaScript]] code.  

It emphasizes minimal runtime overhead, making apps smaller and faster, while maintaining a clean and intuitive syntax.  

## Purpose
Svelte provides developers with a simpler, more performant approach to building reactive UIs without the complexity of traditional virtual DOM diffing.

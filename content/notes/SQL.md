**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the standard language for interacting with **relational databases**. It allows defining schemas, querying data, and managing database structures in a predictable, table-based format.

## Characteristics
- **Structured, relational model**: Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.  
- **Schemas**: Enforces strict rules for data integrity and relationships.  
- **ACID Transactions**: Ensures reliability with atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.  
- **Joins**: Allows combining data across related tables.  

## Advantages
- Strong data integrity and reliability.  
- Powerful querying with joins, filtering, and aggregations.  
- Mature ecosystem and widespread support across industries.  
- Ideal for structured, consistent data models.  

## Limitations
- Less flexible for unstructured or rapidly changing data.  
- Scaling horizontally can be complex compared to [[notes/NoSQL]].  
- Requires predefined schema before storing data.  

## Purpose
SQL databases are best suited for **structured data and transactional applications**, such as banking systems, e-commerce platforms, and enterprise software. They are a core pillar of [[notes/Web Development]] alongside [[notes/NoSQL]] for modern database architectures.

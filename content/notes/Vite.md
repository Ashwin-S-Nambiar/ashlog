Vite is a **next-generation frontend build tool** that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It was created by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js.

## Key Features
### Lightning-Fast Development Server
- Uses native **ES modules** in the browser for instant startup.  
- Provides Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for rapid feedback during development.  
### Optimized Build
- Uses **Rollup** under the hood for production builds.  
- Automatically optimizes assets for smaller bundle sizes.  
### Framework Agnostic
While originally associated with Vue.js, Vite supports frameworks like **[[notes/React]]**, **[[notes/Svelte]]**, and **Preact**.
### Rich Plugin Ecosystem
Supports a growing ecosystem of plugins for extending functionality (e.g., TypeScript, JSX, [[notes/linting]], testing).
### Modern JavaScript Support
Out-of-the-box support for [[notes/TypeScript]], JSX, [[notes/CSS]], and more.

## Advantages
- Faster cold starts and builds compared to older tools like Webpack  
- Simpler configuration and setup  
- Better developer experience with HMR and native ESM  

## Purpose
Vite improves the developer workflow by making development servers **instant and responsive**, and production builds **fast and optimized**. It is particularly useful for modern frontend frameworks such as **[[notes/React]]**.

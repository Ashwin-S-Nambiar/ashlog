**Web Development** is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet. It involves a combination of **frontend development**, **backend development**, and supporting tools or workflows that connect the two.  

At its foundation, web development relies on the triad of [[HTML]], [[CSS]], and [[JavaScript]], extended with modern frameworks, build tools, and deployment workflows.  

## Core Areas
### Frontend Development
The **client-side** portion of web development that focuses on what users see and interact with.  
- Built with [[HTML]] for structure, [[CSS]] for styling, and [[JavaScript]] for interactivity  
- Often uses frameworks like [[React]] to create [[Single Page Applications]]  
- Build tools like [[Vite]] speed up development and optimize production builds  
### Backend Development
The **server-side** portion that manages data, authentication, APIs, and business logic.  
- Can be written in languages like Python, Node.js, Java, Ruby, or PHP  
- Databases (SQL or NoSQL) handle persistent storage  
- REST or GraphQL APIs often connect frontend and backend  
### Full-Stack Development
Refers to working with both frontend and backend technologies, often combining tools like [[React]] (frontend) with Node.js + Express (backend).  

## Key Concepts
### Client-Server Model
Web applications follow a client-server architecture where browsers (clients) send requests to servers, which respond with data or rendered content.  
### Static vs Dynamic Websites
- **Static**: Served as prebuilt pages (good for portfolios or blogs).  
- **Dynamic**: Generated on the fly using backend logic (good for dashboards, ecommerce, etc.).  
### Responsive Design
Ensuring websites adapt to different screen sizes and devices, often handled with [[CSS]] features like **media queries**, Flexbox, and Grid.  
### Progressive Enhancement
Building applications that work on all browsers but offer advanced functionality on modern ones.  
### DevOps and Deployment
Tools like GitHub Actions, Vercel, or Netlify automate deployment pipelines (CI/CD), allowing smooth delivery of changes.  

## Skills Involved
- Strong understanding of [[HTML]], [[CSS]], and [[JavaScript]]  
- Familiarity with frameworks such as [[React]] for frontend  
- Knowledge of server-side programming and APIs  
- Database management (SQL/NoSQL)  
- Version control with Git and GitHub  
- Build tools like [[Vite]] for efficient development workflows

## Purpose
Web Development aims to build applications that are **functional, user-friendly, secure, and scalable**. From static websites to large-scale dynamic applications, it combines design, logic, and infrastructure to bring ideas to life on the internet.

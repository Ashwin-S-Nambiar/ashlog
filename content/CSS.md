CSS (**Cascading Style Sheets**) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML elements. It is a core web technology, alongside **[[HTML]]** and **[[JavaScript]]**, that controls layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web applications.
## Key Features

### Selectors and Pseudo-Classes
CSS provides powerful selectors and pseudo-classes (e.g., `:nth-child`, `:hover`, `:not()`) for precise element targeting.
### Box Model
Defines how elements are sized and spaced, including content, padding, border, and margin.
### Positioning and Layout
Supports positioning techniques (`static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`) as well as layout models like **Flexbox** and **Grid** for modern responsive design.
### Typography and Colors
Controls fonts, text alignment, spacing, and colors using keywords, hex, RGB, HSL, and gradients.
### Transitions and Animations
- Smooth state changes with `transition` properties  
- Keyframe-based animations with `@keyframes`  
### Responsive Design
Media queries enable adaptive styles based on device width, height, or other characteristics.
### Custom Properties (CSS Variables)
Reusable variables defined with the `--variable-name` syntax allow consistency and easier theming.
## Advantages
- Provides precise control over the **look and feel** of web pages  
- Enables **responsive and adaptive** design for multiple devices  
- Separation of structure (HTML) and style (CSS) improves maintainability  
## Purpose
CSS is fundamental for creating **modern, responsive, and visually appealing websites**, giving developers the tools to define layout, styling, and animations in a scalable way.

# JavaScript

JavaScript is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside **[[HTML]]** and **[[CSS]]**, and is supported by all modern browsers.

## Key Features

### Dynamic Typing
Variables in JavaScript are not bound to a specific type. Types are determined at runtime.

### Prototype-Based
JavaScript uses **prototype-based inheritance** instead of classical inheritance models.

### First-Class Functions
Functions are treated as **first-class citizens**, meaning they can be:
- Assigned to variables
- Passed as arguments
- Returned from other functions

### Event-Driven
JavaScript supports **event-driven programming**, making it suitable for interactive UIs and real-time applications.

### Asynchronous Programming
Features like **callbacks, promises, and async/await** allow JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks such as API calls and timers.

## Use Cases
- Building interactive web applications  
- Backend development with environments like **Node.js**  
- Mobile development using frameworks like **React Native**  
- Desktop applications with frameworks like **Electron**

## Purpose
JavaScript enables developers to create **interactive, dynamic, and responsive applications** for the web and beyond, serving as a versatile language for both frontend and backend development.
